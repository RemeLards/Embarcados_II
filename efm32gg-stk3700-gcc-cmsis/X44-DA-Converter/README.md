5 Using the DA Converter
========================


## The DA Converter on the EFM32GG990


The EFM32GG990F1024 in the STK3700 board has one Digital-Analog converter with
2 channels when using single-ended terminals or 1 channel when using differential signals.

It is called DAC0, it is a 12 bit converter and can work at speeds up to 500 Ksps.

It is possible to configure which pins are used by the DA converter. For the
EFM32GG990 the following pins are related to the DAC0:

|  Signal     | Pin(LOC)|         |         |         |         |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| OUT0        | PB11(0) |         |         |         |         |
| OUT0ALT     | PC0(0)  | PC1(1)  | PC2(2)  | PC3(3)  | PD0(4)  |
| OUT1        | PB12(0) |         |         |         |         |
| OUT1ALT     | PD1(4)  |         |         |         |         |
| P0          | PC4(0)  |         |         |         |         |
| P1          | PD6(0)  |         |         |         |         |
| N0          | PC5(0)  |         |         |         |         |
| N1          | PD7(0)  |         |         |         |         |


in the STK3700 board the following signal are available in the Breakout pads and Expansion Header.

There is a prescaler to divide the peripheral clock (HFPERCLK) and
to generate the clock for the DA operation (DAC_CLK). The DA frequency is given by

f_{DAC_CLK) = f_{HFPERCLK}/2^{DA0.CTRL.PRESC)



> The DAC_CLK should be 1 MHz or less!!!!!!. So keep the PRESC at least at 4 when
> running at 48 Mhz.

About alternate pins, the Reference Manual says

> The DAC channels can also drive an alternative output network, which is described in the Opamp
> chapter in Section 30.3.1.2 (p. 735) . To enable this network, OUTMODE must be configured to ADC
> in DACn_CTRL. The actual output network can be configred by configuring DACn_OPAxMUX registers.

It is possible to the output signal go to only to the main output, only to the ALT output or both.

To use only the main output, set DAC0_OPA0MUX.OUTMODE to MAIN.

To use only the ALT output, set DAC0_OPA0MUX.OUTMODE to ALT.

To use output signal at both the main and the ALT outputs, set DAC0_OPA0MUX.OUTMODE
to ALL.

It is also possible to route the output signal to Analog Digital Converter (AD), to an internal OPAMP] or to an Analog Compare Peripheral (ACMP).

Is is possible to reoute the output signal to OUTx pins by set the corresponding bit in DACn_OPAxMUX registers. Note that the OUTPUT field must be set to ADC in order to this routing to work.


The operation can be monitored by observing the STATUS register, specifically, the CH0DV and CH1DV bits,
that when set, indicates that there is still data to be converted on the DATA registers.

There is an additional parameter to be configured: the BIASPROG. It specifies the amount of current thru
the voltage reference. The higher, the better, but with increased power comsumption. From the
Reference Manual.

>The bias current settings should only be changed while both DAC channels are disabled. The electrical
> characteristics given in the datasheet require the bias configuration to be set to the default values, > where no other bias values are given.

The default values can be found in the DEVICE INFO area, specifically, the the DAC0_BIASPROG subarea.
By the way, the Device Info contains other values of interest. It is possible to
use a predefined structure DEVINFO to access part of these values.

The values not accessed through the provided DEVINFO structure should be accessed using
symbols defined by the user/programmer.

## The DA Converter on the EFM32-STK3700

The STK3700 Board has the following signals available on the EXT expansion header.

> The DA pins are also used by other peripherals. Observe that the notation EXPn,
> where n* is the header pin number, is used instead of EXP_HEADERm used in
> the schematics.
